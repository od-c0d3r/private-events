A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. 


## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```

$ cd private-events
```

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Branches

Simply check out the corresponding branch using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout <branch name>
